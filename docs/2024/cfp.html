                <h3 class="h03">Challenge Goal</h3>
                <p>In a survey conducted between 2010 and 2012, 77.1% of accidents involving people aged 65 years and
                    above occurred in their homes. This finding highlights the importance of ensuring the safety of
                    older adults in their homes. We can attract more attention by focusing on this issue in concrete and
                    familiar settings. The "Knowledge Graph Reasoning Challenge for Social Issues" provides a
                    standardized dataset of knowledge graphs and videos that can be used to develop safety technologies
                    for older adults. These technologies can include cyber-physical systems, AI speakers, and AR
                    systems, which can help occupants, home designers, and safety engineering professionals detect
                    accident risks and provide safer alternatives. This year's task is to extract statistical
                    information on interactions with actions and objects that lead to risks in daily life, which will
                    help achieve these goals.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In the workshop, we would like to organize <b>the Second International Knowledge Graph Reasoning
                    Challenge (IKGRC 2024)</b> to discuss a wider variety of reasoning technologies using multimodal
                    data.

                <h3 class="h03">Challenge Task</h3>
                <p>The provided dataset contains video data that shows different daily life actions in VirtualHome.
                    These videos are transformed into knowledge graphs that provide information about the person
                    performing the action, what is involved in the action, and the resulting state or position of the
                    object.<br>
                    The task is to extract statistical
                    information on interactions with actions and objects that lead to risks in daily life.
                    We have prepared 70 episodes and eight specific questions.
                    The task is to answer eight questions for each of the 70 scenarios.
                    All data is available on our github repository (<a
                            href="https://github.com/KnowledgeGraphJapan/KGRC-RDF/tree/kgrc4si">
                        https://github.com/KnowledgeGraphJapan/KGRC-RDF/tree/kgrc4si</a>).
                    <br>
                    We are soliciting entries for the dataset in the following two divisions.
                    <!--
                      <span class="h04">Update history</span><br>
                    In addition to the knowledge graph of “the Speckled Band” provided for Challenge 2018, we provided the knowledge graphs of four additional stories; “The Devil's Foot,” “A Case of Identity,” “The Crooked Man” and “The Dancing Men.” The entrants can use all the five graphs or just one of them as their choice.<br>
                    <b>In Challenge 2019</b>, a new Tool Category Prize will be awarded. In the Tool Category, submissions can be the development of a tool with which a task is partially solved.<br>
                    For example: estimation of the criminal, review of the alibis, explanation of the motives, etc.<br>
                    　　*Submissions of tool that supports knowledge graph construction by “triplification of natural language“ are also acceptable.<br>
                    <b>In Challenge 2020</b>, we provided the knowledge graphs of three additional stories; "The Abbey Grange," "The Resident Patient," and "Silver Blaze."<br>
                    <b>In Challenge 2021</b>, we held <a href="https://kgr4xai.ikgrc.org/" <target="_blank">KGR4XAI: The 1st International Workshop on Knowledge Graph Reasoning for Explainable Artificial Intelligence co-located with 10th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs (IJCKG 2021)</a>. In addition to this workshop, we held the 1st Knowledge Graph Reasoning Challenge for Students.<br>
                    <b>In Challenge 2022</b>, we will hold the 1st International Knowledge Graph Reasoning Challenge. -->

                    <li><b>Phase1 (for beginners):</b> The knowledge graph provided contains all the information and

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Phase2 (for advanced):</b> The knowledge graph provided is partially anonymized
                        information, and each question must be answered by predicting that information from the
                        knowledge graph or video.
