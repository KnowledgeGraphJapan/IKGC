		  <h3 class="h03">Challenge Goal</h3>
		  <p>Recent advances in machine learning have led to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to a variety of social problems. Accordingly, being able to explain the reason for an AI decision is becoming important to ensure the secure and safe use of AI techniques.</p> 
		<p>On this background, the Knowledge Graph Reasoning Challenge has been organized from 2018 in Japan. It 	aims to promote techniques for explainable AI using knowledge graphs.
		In the challenge, the task is to estimate the culprits with a reasonable explanation using a dataset of knowledge graphs representing eight Sherlock Holmes mystery stories. The challenge has been held four times in Japan, and 24 approaches have been proposed and fruitfully discussed, including approaches to solving the constraint satisfaction problem, logical inference, and machine learning techniques including knowledge graph embedding.</p>
		<br>
	<p>In the workshop, we would like to organize <b>the First International Knowledge Graph Reasoning Challenge (IKGRC 2023)</b> to discuss a wider variety of knowledge graph reasoning technologies for explainable AI.
			</p>
		  </section>
		  <section>
		  <h3 class="h03">Challenge Task</h3>
		  <p>The subject set for the Challenge is the cases in Sherlock Holmes short stories in which Holmes solved mysterious crimes.<br>
			The task is to reason and/or estimate the truth of the case while providing a reasonable explanation based on the relevant <b>open <a href="https://github.com/KnowledgeGraphJapan/KGRC-RDF">knowledge graphs</b>.</a><br>
			The right answer of the task is to arrive at the same conclusion as Holmes, that is, to explain the truth of the case that Holmes solved.<br>
			<br>
			We are soliciting entries for the dataset in the following three divisions.
			  <!-- 
				<span class="h04">Update history</span><br>
			  In addition to the knowledge graph of “the Speckled Band” provided for Challenge 2018, we provided the knowledge graphs of four additional stories; “The Devil's Foot,” “A Case of Identity,” “The Crooked Man” and “The Dancing Men.” The entrants can use all the five graphs or just one of them as their choice.<br>
              <b>In Challenge 2019</b>, a new Tool Category Prize will be awarded. In the Tool Category, submissions can be the development of a tool with which a task is partially solved.<br>
			  For example: estimation of the criminal, review of the alibis, explanation of the motives, etc.<br>
			  　　*Submissions of tool that supports knowledge graph construction by “triplification of natural language“ are also acceptable.<br>
              <b>In Challenge 2020</b>, we provided the knowledge graphs of three additional stories; "The Abbey Grange," "The Resident Patient," and "Silver Blaze."<br>
              <b>In Challenge 2021</b>, we held <a href="https://kgr4xai.ikgrc.org/" <target="_blank">KGR4XAI: The 1st International Workshop on Knowledge Graph Reasoning for Explainable Artificial Intelligence co-located with 10th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs (IJCKG 2021)</a>. In addition to this workshop, we held the 1st Knowledge Graph Reasoning Challenge for Students.<br>
              <b>In Challenge 2022</b>, we will hold the 1st International Knowledge Graph Reasoning Challenge. -->

		  <h3 class="h03">Task Execution Conditions</h3>
			  <ul class="ul01"><li>1. Reasoning should be based on the given knowledge graphs, with various range of use:
				  <ul class="ul02"><li>a）Cover-all: use the whole knowledge graph</li>
					  <li>b）Cover-a-part (90%): use the triples from the fist ID up to 10 % before the last ID</li>
	<li>c）Cover-a-part (75%): use the triples from the first ID up to 25% before the last ID<br>(The reference ID numbers are to be published).</li></ul>
				  </li>
				  <li>2. You can extend the knowledge graphs by yourself (e.g. complement of common sense knowledge).</li>
				  <li>3. Pull requests are welcome in case you find any error in the given knowledge graphs (e.g. typos, inconsistency, etc.).</li>
			  </ul>
